                <b>Hello.</b><br>
                You might find this to be a bit weird.<br>
                But this is what i have to say after this long week.<br>
                <br>
                I have been trying to hide my feelings, ever since knowing that he existed.<br>
                I thought it's for the better, oh how wrong i was.<br>
                <br>
                Seeing you getting along with someone else is nice, not really.<br>
                Hurts my soul to even see.<br>
                <br>
                Had a nightmare today, everything ended in it. Literally everything.<br>
                Because of one specific person.<br>
                To be fair it is my fault, like really my fault.<br>
                <br>
                Anyways back to the nightmare thing.<br>
                In that nightmare, well, which is probably going to happen soon.<br>
                I really hope it doesn't happen IRL cause that would make me kms.<br>
                <br>
                I dreamed about you, and that other person, walking around.<br>
                I said "Hello", no response.<br>
                Then, you two started... well... <a class="hidden-text"> holding hands </a>.<br>
                I remember myself trying to stop it from happening.<br>
                But i failed, miserably. I remember myself sinking into the ground, helpless.<br>
                Then i woke up, at 3 in the morning.<br>
                Tried to make myself fall asleep again but i couldn't<br>
                Thought about it for a solid three hours before getting out of my bed, realises that it might actually happen.<br>
                <br>
                Looking through the conversations i missed, because of <del>jail</del> concentration camp,<br>
                kinda kills my mood.<br>
                <br>
                I don't mind you talking to other men, really.<br>
                Call me selfish and all but, i don't really like how you are that close to another male.<br>
                Does that make me insecure? Well, <b>yes</b>.<br>
                Do you have to care? No.<br>
                <br>
                These few days has been rough.<br>
                Knowing that exams are coming up makes me even more miserable.<br>
                Hope you study, for yourself.<br>
                <br>
                I don't even know anymore. What is right, what is wrong.<br>
                Maybe i'm just not good enough after all.<br>
                Don't bother replying if you don't care.<br>
                If you wanna, just give me an answer, a guide on what i should do, or what's next.<br>
                <b>Ciao.</b><br><br>
